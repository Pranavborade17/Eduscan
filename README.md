# EduScan

EduScan is an intelligent student dress code and compliance monitoring system designed for colleges and schools. It automatically detects violations such as improper dress code, missing helmets, or absent ID cards, and sends real-time alerts to administrators for quick action.

## Features

- **Automated Dress Code Detection:** Uses advanced computer vision to monitor and identify students who are not adhering to the prescribed dress code.
- **Helmet & ID Card Check:** Detects if students are missing helmets (for riders) or ID cards.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Instantly notifies admin or authorized personnel when a violation is detected.
- **Dashboard & Logs:** Provides an administrative interface to review alerts, view statistics, and manage records.
- **Customizable Rules:** Adaptable to different institutional policies and requirements.

## How It Works

1. **Monitoring:** Cameras placed at entry points or strategic locations capture images or video streams of students.
2. **Detection:** EduScan processes the feeds to identify dress code violations, missing helmets, and ID cards using AI models.
3. **Alerting:** Upon detecting a violation, the system generates a real-time alert and notifies the admin via dashboard, email, or SMS.
